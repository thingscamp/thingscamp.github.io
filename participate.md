ThingsCamp 5 came to Birmingham in June and this time we had TWO events: a traditional ThingsCamp on Saturday the 16th of June and something a little more business-focused on the 19th. We'll be sharing what we learned soon. We're currently planning the next few ThingsCamp events.

If you want to support us or help out in any way with a future event you can [connect with us through this page](http://things.camp/connect/) or just get in touch through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thingscamp).
